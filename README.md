A batch file renaming utility in Python
---------------------------------------

This is a simple file renaming utility written in Python that I've written (with inspiration) as a first step in a program I hope will eventually automatically rename all of my media files according to the [Plex Media Naming and Organization Guide](http://wiki.plexapp.com/index.php/Media_Naming_and_Organization_Guide).

While original intentions for the script are to rename media, this script can rename any type of file, according to any standards you choose.
